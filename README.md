# news

This is an application dedicated to news. The user will see news for his country, thanks to an api that returns the country for the user's ip address. It is also possible to select from a list of available countries. The page shows the number of news items that are currently available and the current time. When you click on a particular news item, a popup will appear with the content and a link to the article. It is possible to switch the news view from tiles to a list, and the page has a choice of dark or light mode.

## Technologies

I made this procjet wtih help of React, TypeScript, React-Redux, React Router, Tailwindcss and two api's (news and ip).
I also made my own json file to make it easier to work with the sidebar.

## How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/JakubSepetowski/news.git
