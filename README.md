# news

## What i used?

I made this procjet wtih help of React, TypeScript, React-Redux, React Router, Tailwindcss and two api's (news and ip).
I also made my own json file to make it easier to work with the sidebar.
Unfortunately I was not able to do the tests for the application.

## How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/JakubSepetowski/news.git
cd news
npm i
npm run dev - for start localhost
go to http://localhost:5173/

```
